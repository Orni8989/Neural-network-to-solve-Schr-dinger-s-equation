# Neural Network for Solving the Schr√∂dinger Equation
This project demonstrates the use of a neural network to solve the Schr√∂dinger equation. It includes two main components: a neural network class for modeling the system and a trainer class for data training and evaluation. The project evaluates the performance of the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) curves and reproduces data from the Schr√∂dinger equation solutions.

## Project Structure
### NeuralNetwork Class
This class defines the architecture of the neural network used to approximate the solutions of the Schr√∂dinger equation. It includes customizable parameters such as the number of layers and neurons per layer, along with activation functions.

### Trainer Class
The Trainer class handles data loading, training, and evaluation. It includes methods for optimizing the neural network using gradient descent and visualizing training progress with MSE curves.

### Evaluation
After training, the model is evaluated to ensure its accuracy and ability to reproduce data from the Schr√∂dinger equation. The evaluation includes:

Plotting MSE curves to assess training performance.

Comparing the model's predictions with exact or reference solutions.

## Features
Fully customizable neural network architecture.

Training loop with real-time MSE visualization.

Data reproduction and comparison with analytical solutions.
